### I suppose as with all things, we need an introduction.

#### As Context is so important ...

<pre>
Casio -> TI-81 -> TI-82 -> TI-83 ->
  ... (beautiful dev memories) ...

-> Tandy (intel 286),
  A for loop in BASIC using PEEK and POKE,
  An attempt to find the locations of video memory,
  Hoping to see screen pixels changing colors at breakneck speeds,
  My dreams dashed as my Dad's Tandy is no more,
  ... (unpleasant dev memories) ...

  ... time passes ...

  ... yet more time passes ...

-> My sister's (intel 486 + My fathers stern warnings),
  An older sister's compassion toward her aspiring code junkie brother,
  QBASIC screen mode 13 (320 x 200, 256 colors),
  PEEK and POKE (never to be used again),
  Modifying Nibbles.bas and the Monkey game
  ... (beautiful dev memories) ...

The rest is history...

A passion for the creativity and enjoyment potential in the development of software.
